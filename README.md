"Sau" is German for "pig". Thus, sau is Pig Latin processor implemented in Python.

Main purpose of the project is to "teach" disco speak Pig Latin, and so to enable running Pig Latin scripts on Disco the way they can be ran on Hadoop.

Friendly comments and contribution are very welcome.

Current status: very bloody alpha under development. Tested while working on Disco.
