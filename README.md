"Sau" is German for "pig". Thus, sau is Pig Latin processor implemented Python.

Parser/lexer are generated using antlr3 from the slightly modified Pig Latin grammars.

Main purpose of the project is to "teach" disco speak Pig Latin, and so to enable running Pig Lating scripts on Disco the way they can be ran on Hadoop.

Friendly comments and contribution are very welcome.
